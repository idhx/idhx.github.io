## General enquiries, invitations, etc.

The easiest way to get in touch with me is via [email](mailto:i.deschenaux@lse.ac.uk). Please write with questions about my work, talk and lecture invitations, enquiries about consulting services.

## LSE students & staff

If you are an LSE student you can book a slot for my office hours on the LSE [student hub](https://studenthub.lse.ac.uk/). Feel free to come and chat with me about anything, not just the content of my courses.

I occasionally host the LSE Department of Methodology's [methods surgery](https://www.lse.ac.uk/Methodology/Methods-Surgery/Methods-surgery). Please get in touch if you want to know when I am doing this next.
